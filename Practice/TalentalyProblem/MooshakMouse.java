// Mooshak Mouse
// Problem Statement:
// Mooshak the mouse has been placed in a maze.There is a huge chunk of cheese somewhere in the maze. The maze is represented as a two dimensional array of integers, where 0 represents walls.1 repersents paths where mooshak can move and 9 represents the huge chunk of cheese.
// Mooshak starts in the top left corner at 0. Write a method is Path of class Maze Path to determine if Mooshak can reach the huge chunk of cheese. The input to is Path consists of a two dimensional array gnd for the maze matrix. the method should return 1 if there is a path from Mooshak to the cheese.and 0 if not Mooshak is not allowed to leave the maze or climb on walls.
// EX: 8 by 8(8*8) matrix maze where Mooshak can get the cheese.
// 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
// 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
// 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
// 1 0 1 0 9 0 1 1
// 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
// 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
// 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
// 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

// Input Format:
// The input to is Path consists of a two dimensional array size and the values for the maze matrix
// Output Format:
// return 1 if there is a path and 0 if not
// Constraints:
// N/A
// Sample Input :

// 6
// 1 0 1 9 1 0
// 1 1 1 1 1 1
// 0 1 1 0 1 0
// 1 1 1 1 1 1
// 0 1 1 0 1 1
// 0 1 1 1 1 1

// Sample Output :

// 1
